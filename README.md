# R-projects

Two short projects in R for my undergraduate coursework:
 * Time series analysis - we were given some time series data and a questions sheet. I used R to produce simple outputs and analysed it.
 * Experimental Design - currently working on it.

Both projects are not yet complete as deadlines are in May 2021.
